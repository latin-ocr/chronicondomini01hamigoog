vi caurien.

where, after the table of Contents, and before
the first sermon, we find the following rubrio:
-“The Book of· St. Mary's, Gisborough, pre-
sented to tho cabinet of the cloister; the gift of
friar Walter de Hemingburgh‚ formerly Canon
of the said house, viz. Α. Ι). 130’7.”1 As the
Priory Church was destroyed by fire in May
1289, with many and valuable books of theology‚
chaliceS, vestments‚ etc„ it is likely that such a
gift would be the more acceptable. The rubrio,
although at first sight it might lead us to assign
the death of Hemingburgh to 1307, bears inter-

· = nal evidence of having been written at a period

considerably subsequent to the work itself‚ and

Ἴ therefore we must not attach much importance to
the quondam the date probably refers to thetime
of the donation.

By Leland‚ on whom as an accurate and labo-
rious antiquary much reliance may be placed,
Walter Hemingburgh is thus mentioned: “Guar-
terius HemengohurguS‚ a canon of the Priory
of Gisborough, near clive, a small district in
Yorkshire‚ adjacent to the famous river Teos, ’
was much attached to the study of letters; by
which eventually it followed that he became
a learned man, and gained sor himself no small
credit with his contemporaries. For literature
is such a recommendation‚ that it readily obtains

for its possessor favour, honour, and ‘even glory.
