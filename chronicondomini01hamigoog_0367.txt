APPENDIX.

ῃ

Tua following Appendix contains a summary of the
differenoes between the copies preserved by Heming-
burgh, and those printed from the original ex'emplars in
the body of this work, of the Magna Charta and Charta
de Foresta by Henry III. in 1225, the Confirmation of
these Charters in 1237 hythe same king, and the sen·
terroe of Excommunication denounced against those who
should violate them, in 1253. The general reasons which
led to the adoption of this plan having boen stated in
the Prefaoe, it is needless to recapitulata them here.
An additional cause, however, not there mentioned, jus·
tifies the measure, as far as regards this Chroniole, in a
more particular way; viz. that Hemingburgh had given
the great oharters of English liberty of 1225, with the
preamble of those granted by Henry III. in the first year
of his reign, by advice of Gualo the papal legate, the
Earl os Pemhrolre, and other nobleS, thus oonsounding
tho tvvo sets of charters together3 a species of inaccu-
raoy, as Sir W. Blaokstone remarks, very frequent in
the monkish historiens, or the registers of those abbeys

from whence they drew their materials.
