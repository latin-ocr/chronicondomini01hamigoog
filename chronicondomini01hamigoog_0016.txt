X PREFAOE·

burgus into Hemmyngsorde admits of no elucida-
tion; nor does it appear that the family of Hem·
ingford had ever any transaction with the Priory
of Gisborough.¹ The entry in the Abingdon
Chronicle, in the Public Library at Cambridge,

Dd. ii. 5, is·but a repetition from Bale, as the
words “provinciolam Thesi flumini adjacentem,''
and indeed the whole entry, plainly cheu. It
thus appears that Balaio the year 1549, or his
contemporary, Horman‚ was the first to pervert
our author's name, which error has been in-
advertently followed by othere. Tanner and
Hearnc, however, were aware of the mistake.
Every circumstance would lead us to conclude
that Walter de Hemingburgh was born of an in·
fluential family² in the neighbourhood os Hem-
ingborough, in the wapentake of Oose and Der-
went, in the East Biding of York‚ and at some
distance from the Priory of Gishorough in the
North Riding, once the principal cemetery for ’
the nobility of the surrounding country. Thither
he was sent for his education, as was the custom
in early times, where, by the attention of the
pious monks‚ his taste sor learning and the study
of theology was successfully cultivated, and
where the beauty of the rich and fertile vale, and
the romantio hill country that surrounds the
Priory, lent their aid to form and elevate the
mind of the student, and offered a free scope for
. quiet and undisturbed meditation. Thero he
made such proficiency as Leland describes, and
